# Notable Quotes

When I read Steinbeck's _Winter of Our Discontent_, there were three quotes that stood out to me. They are listed below.


> It's harder to give away fish than it is to catch them.


This quote is great for motivating somebody to move forwards and work harder—worry about giving things away only once you have things to give away.

> 'You who handle poverty badly will handle riches equally badly.' And that is true. In poverty she is envious. In riches she may be a snob. Money does not change the sickness, only the symptoms.

Careful with wanting too much at a time—you may not need it or deserve it.
 
> Strength and success - they are above morality, above criticism. It seems, then, that it is not what you do, but how you do it and what you call it. Is there a check in men, deep in them, that stops or punishes? There doesn't seem to be. The only punishment is for failure.
 
This is my favorite quote from any work of literature. It guides me to simply be succesful—after that, everything will shape itself.
 

## The presence of game theory in actors' decisions in _To Kill a Mockingbird_.

A paper I wrote once was titled "Collusion and Moral Ambiguity in _To Kill a Mockingbird_: Exploring the Role of Game Theory in Achieving Ends." The paper was meant to be a 600-word reflection, and I turned it into a 1500-word paper analyzing the motives of characters on the stand. It turns out that achieving ends in Harper Lee's world requires a sacrifice of morals, but that over-sacrificing inevitably leads to the destruction of oneself.


# Code

Here is some code. It is from this website, may be outdated, and shouldn't be judged too harshly. This file is a placeholder.


```py
import sys
import pyperclip

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python3 md_to_prisma_copy_and_paste.py <file_path>")
        sys.exit(1)
    file_path = sys.argv[1]
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        file_contents = file.read()
    file_contents = file_contents.replace('\n', '\\n')
    pyperclip.copy(file_contents)
    print("File contents copied to clipboard")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Prisma Studio is terrible — you can't paste in newlines. This is unfortunate because it means that I would have to manually add `\n` at the end of every line in my markdown files — which is definitely not an option. In order to address this, I wrote a quick python script that fixes it. It can be seen above. Also, you can [find it on GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/borisnezlobin/91aa0b2c95d5e63264ee4da2d7649fc9). Let's try this embed:

Hope for the best!

# Mathematics

What if this blog supported writing math expressions, like $e^x$, or math equations like
$$
\begin{bmatrix}a & b \\ c & d\end{bmatrix}^{-1}=\frac{1}{ad-bc}\begin{bmatrix}d & -b\\ -c & a\end{bmatrix}.
$$
Wouldn't that be nice? How do you prove that $e^{\pi}< \pi^e$?

# X Embeds

Let's try embedding one of my hilarious tweets. I'm sure you'll like it.

<Tweet tweetId="1817713386102428029" />

Turns out, Tweets are *very* hard to embed, and even when you can embed them, it takes several seconds to load them + for them to become interactive. Luckily, there's an [amazing solution available](https://react-tweet.vercel.app/next). Take a look!
