**Rhetorical Situation.**<br />
The occasion of the text: where, when, and for whom it was published.
1. Parts of a situation:
	1. Subject. The topic of the text, the issue at hand. Should account for the entirety of the text.
	2. Author. The person or group who creates the text. Are they credentialed to talk on this subject? Every author brings their own identity and experiences to their text.
	3. Genre. The form of the text. Authors select appropriate genres given the specific demands of the occasion. For example, a TikTok wouldn't be better than a eulogy at a funeral.
	4. Context. The broader factors of where and when it was created — the historical, cultural, and social conditions of its time.
	5. Exigence (need). The urgency or motivation that gives rise to the text, that compels the author to create the text *now*. An event, a need, requirement, etc. Consider my PAUSD MVC article — it had a need after the PAUSD cancelled MVC.
	6. Audience. The reader/listener/viewer of the text.Effective authors imagine a most specific, target audience. Factors about the audience contribute to how the author conveys their message.
	7. Purpose. The goal the author wants to achieve with the audience. The author hopes to make the audience do/feel/think/believe something. Layered purpose: for complex texts, the purpose is often a layered sequence of sub-purposes — the author wants the audience to do/feel/think one thing, then another, and so on.

There are three types of rhetorical appeal:
- Ethos: how you convince an audience that you are credible
- Logos: the use of logic and reason. Analogies, examples, and research.
- Pathos: irrational (appeal to emotion).

How a speaker perceives the relationships between these three elements will influence how they come across.
