# Sequences and Series

<InfoBox type="definition">
**Sequence**<br />
A sequence is an ordered list of numbers. A **term** is an item in the sequence, and the term's **index** tells us where in the sequence that term is.
</InfoBox>

We typically denote sequences and series with a name like this:
$$
{a_n}=\{1, 2, 4, 8,...\}
$$
Most of the time, we can also write them as functions:
$$
a_n=f(n).
$$
For example, $a_n=\{3^n\}$. We can define sequences recursively: $a_n=f(a_{n-1})$.
(note: "$n$" is typically used for counting numbers (integers). So, $f(n)$ is typically discrete, whereas $f(x)$ is typically a continuous function).

<InfoBox type="definition">
**Convergence**<br />
A sequence $\{a_n\}$ converges if $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=L\in\mathbb{R}$. Since we are always going to look at limits at infinity, we often simplify to $\lim a_n=L\in\mathbb{R}$. If a sequence does not converge, it is divergent (who would've guessed...). For example, we say that $\frac{1}{n^2}$ *converges to 0*.

<InfoBox type="definition">
**Series**<br />
An infinite series is a sequence of partial sums:
$$
S_n= \sum_{k=1}^n a_n.
$$
</InfoBox>

A series converges if $\lim_{n\to\infty}S_n=L\in \mathbb{R}$. Otherwise, it diverges.

**Geometric Series**<br />
A geometric series is a series of a sequence of a constant times a ratio to the $n$th:
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty ar^{n-1}.$$
If we consider $s_n=a+ar+ar^2+\dots+ar^{n-1}$, then we'll see:
$$s_n(1-r)=a-ar^n,$$
which (when $r\neq1$) means
$$s_n=\frac{a-ar^n}{1-r}.$$
To determine whether the geometric series diverges, we need to determine whether the limit of $s_n$ as $n$ approaches infinity is a number. Think about it: if $|r|>1$, then the numerator will approach infinity (or negative infinity). So, a geometric series converges if and only if $|r|< 1$. In that case, the limit is simply $\frac{a}{1-r}$! (p.s. obviously, if $r=1$, we just take the infinite sum: $s_n=an$ as $n$ approaches infinity... which clearly diverges.)

This test for geometric series (known as the geometric series test) is one of a number of convergence tests.

### Convergence Tests

How do we determine whether a series converges? It is often quite difficult — for example, does $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}$ converge? We can use a number of tests to determine whether a series converges:

1. Divergence Test. If $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\neq 0$, then $\sum a_n$ diverges. Use this test before all others! However, remember that the Divergence Test is not an "if and only if" statement — the only thing it can guarantee is whether a given series diverges (just because the test doesn't say it diverges doesn't mean it doesn't — consider the harmonic series).
2. Geometric Series. A geometric series $\sum ar^{n-1}$ converges if and only if $|r|< 1$.
3. Comparison Test. Suppose that $0\leq a_n\leq b_n$ and $\sum b_n$ converges. Then, $\sum a_n$ converges. By similar logic, if $a_n\geq  c_n$ and $\sum c_n$ diverges, then $\sum a_n$ also diverges.
4. Integral Test. Suppose $f(x)$ is a continuous, positive, decreasing (all three of these must hold!) function for  $x \geq 1$, and that $f(n)$ represents the terms of the sequence $a_n$ for which you are summing the series $\sum a_n$. Then, the series $\sum a_n$ converges if and only if the improper integral $\int_1^\infty f(x)dx$ converges. I recommend watching [Dr. Trefor Bazett's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHTS3WMU7aA) about this test for a visual representation.
5. Limit Comparison Test. If the ratio $\frac{a_n}{b_n}$ approaches a positive limit $L$, then $\sum a_n$ and $\sum b_n$ both either converge or both diverge.
