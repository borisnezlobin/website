## Summary

I'm working on turning XFCE and the X11 Window System into a 3-dimensional window rendering system that integrates with the physical environment they're in. I'm doing this because I want to learn more about operating systems, graphics, and Linux.
My end goal is to have a 3D operating system (based off of Ubuntu) that has high utility but isn't limited to a 13-inch computer screen — something that augments and utilizes your environment. I'm not sure if I'll ever get there, but I'm having fun trying! I'm also learning a lot along the way.

To be honest, I think that Apple's VisionOS is wrong in its approach to, everything, and I'd love to prove it (...it's actually been very difficult so far).
