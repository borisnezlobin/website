>A Firefox add-on that lets user create Regex- or domain-based rules to set time limits for tabs. Also includes website usage statistics and a delayed delete feature for limits.

## Summary

Lim (originally named "L!m", but nobody likes special characters) is a Firefox add-on that lets users create rules to set time limits for tabs. The rules can be based on regular expressions or domain names, and can only be deleted the day after they are queued for deletion. Lim also includes a feature that shows website usage statistics and the number of pickups for each website.

I made Lim because I wanted to learn more about Firefox add-ons and because I wanted to limit my time on certain websites (I was procrastinating Physics on Instagram, so I made Lim... to procrastinate Physics).
