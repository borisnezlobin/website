>A lightweight 3D graphics engine from scratch with rasterization and ray tracing support, capable of rendering .obj models with basic lighting.

## Summary

I LOVE math. I thought making a renderer would require at least a little bit more math than making a portfolio website... yeah. Yeah it was more math. I love math.

Learned a lot about applying theoretical knowledge (especially in linear algebra) to a real-world *thing*, and it was actually way more eye-opening than I thought it would be.
I ended up having to write good code (oh no...) and think things out before writing them (oh NO).

## Features

- Drawing `.obj` files.
- Drawing triangles
- Self-implemented, very sketchy line-drawing algorithm
- Depth mapping to avoid overdraw
- Lighting? What's that?

## Technologies

My favorite language, C. Also used my favorite IDE, CLion. That's a joke. Every 30 minutes CLion stops saving the modified buffer to disk and so re-running the code doesn't change anything and I have to force-quit CLion (because normal quitting doesn't work) and restart it. I hate everything that isn't TypeScript or my girlfriend.
