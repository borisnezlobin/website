>My portfolio website: a corner of the internet. A place for my blog posts, class notes, and project writeups.

## Summary

This portfolio website lets me showcase who I am and what I work on. I made it primarily to learn NextJS and Prisma, but also got carried away with the design and features. I also use this website to write blog posts about my projects and experiences. Check out [my blog](/blog) or [my open-source class notes](/notes)!

## Features

I got carried away. There are too many to list. I learned a lot by making them, and hopefully you'll enjoy them! The polish is in the detail: did you notice the random quote on the blog page? Or that it shows how many stars each project has on GitHub? Or that my blog [has a search page](/blog/search)?

You'll have to explore to find them all (and no, of course I'm not saying that just to grow my organic user interaction)!

## Technologies

Building this website taught me a lot â€” I didn't know anything at all about NextJS or SSG before starting! Here are some of the technologies I used:
- NextJS
- Prisma
- Tailwind CSS
- PostgresSQL
- Vercel
- And, previously: `next-mdx-remote` (check out [the blog post I wrote](/blog/mdx-embeds) that is barely related!)
