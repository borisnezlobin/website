This article consists of a collection of personal stories that illustrate how the Palo Alto Unified School District's (PAUSD) treatment of prerequisites fundamentally disadvantages students interested in taking more challenging classes. In general, PAUSD exacts higher standards from students looking to get ahead than it does from students following the standard, "suggested" pathway. If anything, PAUSD should hold students looking to get ahead to *lower* standards than other students — but that's beyond this article. Across most subjects, the district forces students looking to skip into an advanced class to demonstrate a level of understanding higher than the level of the class itself. Furthermore, many policies implemented by the district in recent years make it generally near-impossible to earn credit for college-level courses, which disadvantages students who have exhausted the scarce mathematical opportunities the district provides.

In this article, I'll present three of my experiences where PAUSD has failed to apply just policies. In all of them, I'll sound quite pretentious — but while the wording is subject to my whims, the facts are indisputable.

The first focuses on math. PAUSD has a long history of having opaque and incomprehensible math policies. When I first arrived in the district in 8th grade, I was placed in "Math 8." It took me a week to realize that there were in fact three different lanes, and I was (by default) in the lowest of them. PAUSD had not informed myself or my parents of this, and I only learned about the math lane structure from fellow students. So, I asked my math teacher if I could move up to Algebra 1 (the normal math lane). The answer was, "I don't think so." I talked to my counselor, this time armed with my BMO <Footnote id="1">For the Americans: BMO is the British equivalent of the AIME, but maybe a little bit less impressive.</Footnote> qualification and stories about how my British math teacher had taught me trigonometry on the side <Footnote id="2">In PAUSD, that's 10th grade math</Footnote>. Until my parents got involved with school administration, however, I wasn't even allowed into the *normal* math lane at school. By default, PAUSD had placed me in the lowest possible math lane, communicated nothing about other lanes, and then worked to prevent me from moving into the *standard* math lane.

Two years later, I wanted to take Multivariable Calculus (MVC) at Foothill, my local community college. The class had a prerequisite of only introductory differential and integral calculus. I wanted to sign up for the summer term, by which time I would have my AP Calculus BC grade (I was confident I would get a 5 — and I did). However, the district prevented me from signing up because I hadn't completed my PAUSD graduation requirements (of Algebra 2/Trigonometry Honors, 10th grade math). PAUSD prevents off-campus courses from receiving credit until 10th grade mathematics is completed. Even when off-campus courses are approved, they are limited to Credit/No Credit grades — but more on that later. I ended up taking a no-credit (that's not "No Credit", it's "no credit" — it doesn't appear on my transcript at all) Linear Algebra course at Stanford over the summer because I hadn't been allowed to sign up for the summer term of MVC. I got a 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam and an A in Linear Algebra — but neither can appear on my transcript. Notice the issue? PAUSD actively works against students taking more advanced courses, whether on campus or not. Past AP Calculus BC, there is only one math class offered by PAUSD. Paired with no credit for off-campus courses (except under strict circumstances), it is impossible to earn the required graduation credit (40 credits, or 4 years of math) without following the suggested lanes set by PAUSD... but what if I want to learn multivariable calculus in high school? I would have to spend two years in math classes below my level, despite having completed  the most advanced math offered by PAUSD (AP Calculus BC, 12th-grade math). The district's excuse for preventing me from registering, that I hadn't completed my graduation requirements, doesn't even seem to apply uniformly — three of my friends were allowed to skip Geometry Honors (a graduation requirement), while I was not. Needless to say, the district [has been sued over its math policies](https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2023/03/03/judge-rules-high-school-math-policy-violates-state-law/), though no tangible changes have emerged as a result.

Let's talk more about how PAUSD treats off-campus courses. In the 2023-24 school year, PAUSD offered concurrent enrollment Multivariable Calculus (MVC). As an eighth period, it was about an hour after school to allow students from the other high school, Henry M. Gunn, to commute to Palo Alto High School. Demand for this class was about 50 students (in a classroom made for 30). This meant that students taking the class had to bring camping chairs to school or sit on the floor. The next year, instead of offering more sections or making the class more accessible, PAUSD cancelled it entirely (despite nearly 80 students expressing interest). The reasoning for this decision was never disclosed — I've sent numerous emails to administrators, but haven't heard back. For people like me looking to take the class, Foothill offered an online asynchronous class. However, by the time registration opened for high school students, there was one (1) seat left, and only 7 waitlist spots. All filled up in the first five minutes of registration, leaving more than 20 PAUSD students without even a spot on the waitlist — that is, without a math class to take. To be fair, there was one more option for these students: take the in-person MVC Honors class (Honors was the only section not full) at De Anza College (a 20-minute drive away) in the middle of the day every Tuesday and Thursday (which would mean skipping every single third period class that semester — which was obviously not an option). There were a few other options, but it seems all I do is [whinge and complain](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxK43YT_Vs_I8eGtnrxtnnu3ps4vmdjMPV?si=ufa31G7Ncg9pKhLU), so if you're interested in how uniquely *bad* PAUSD is at listening to students (which it claims to do) and supporting its students (which it also claims to do), [check out my other article](/blog/pausd-mvc).

I can imagine there are some arguments to be made for keeping students in math — after all, I’ve [spoken at a board meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrSluygBAMs) with several dozen other students where we address each of PAUSD's concerns. I’ve also explained how [the district’s opacity and bewilderingly unjustified policies inhibit students](/blog/pausd-mvc). It seems to me that math is a touchy subject for PAUSD board.

Let's move on to computer science, an elective (electives are classes that aren't required, but a student can choose to take them). At my school, before taking the AP Computer Science A class (n.b., APCSA is an *introductory* Java class), students have to take either Function-Object Oriented Programming (FOOP, an introductory Python course), FOOP Honors (a more difficult version of FOOP), or AP Computer Science Principles (a class that uses block coding, skims certain things like how data is stored, and does little else). All four of these classes (FOOP, FOOP H, APCSP, and APCSA) are introductory — they are each designed (by the College Board) to *teach* their respective material. One has to ask — why does APCSA have a prerequisite? I cleared the prerequisites after talking to the Director of CS (not the real title), and I got a perfect score in both semesters and a 5 on the AP test. How did I clear my prerequisites? I had to show the Director that I was familiar with "advanced" data structures (I was asked to explain how a binary search tree worked) and had real-world experience (I was on the software team for a world-class robotics team using Java). To be clear, the most advanced topic covered in APCSA was the ArrayList — to take the class, I guarantee that no student needs to know heaps, stacks, binary search trees, hardware interfaces, or concurrency. One does not need 100 solved LeetCode problems to take APCSA (interestingly, the Director asked me to show my LeetCode profile). According to the [PAHS course catalog](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1723757800/pausdorg/cf9krjxdx27jthdjknt9/PalyCourseCatalog24-25v7.pdf) (page 40), APCSA "introduces students to computer science through programming in Java." To summarize, taking an *introductory* Java course at Palo Alto High School requires you to spend a year in classes that have no relevance to APCSA, or to demonstrate a knowledge of computer science far beyond the level covered in the class. One has to ask: why?

Despite the district's actions and policies, there is hope. See, all of these issues are only for people that follow the rules. Nobody ever got ahead by following the rules, so one of my friends decided to experiment with the system. During course selection, he enrolled for an Honors math course three years ahead of his lane as a joke. He spent two weeks in that class the next year before dropping — not a single administrator or teacher noticed that he wasn't supposed to be there. Not only that, but several of my friends ended up 3 years ahead in math without having taken Geometry Honors (a “graduation requirement that needs to be taken on campus,” in the district's words) because administrators allowed them to. Why didn't they allow me? I don't know, but PAUSD seems to be against laning up in all its forms — except it doesn't even check prerequisites at course registration, meaning that their strict policies only apply to people who follow the rules.

The truth is that PAUSD’s policies apply non-uniformly, fail to accurately assess competency, and are inimical to student’s pursuits.
