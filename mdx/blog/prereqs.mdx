>A denunciation of PAUSD's opaque, fundamentally flawed policies that directly disadvantage students pursuing more advanced education.

*Names in this article are fictional unless otherwise stated.*<br>This article consists of a collection of personal stories (my own included) that illustrate how the Palo Alto Unified School District's (PAUSD) treatment of prerequisites fundamentally disadvantages students interested in taking more challenging (I’d go so far as to use the term “stimulating,” but I recognize that’s not the case for everyone) classes. In general, PAUSD exacts higher standards from students looking to get ahead than it does from students following the suggested path. Typically, students who are determined to get ahead are also more motivated (xxxxxxx) to do well; if anything, PAUSD should hold students looking to get ahead to *lower* standards than other students. Across most subjects, the district forces students looking to skip into an advanced class to demonstrate a level of understanding higher than the level of the class itself. Furthermore, many policies implemented by the district in recent years make it generally near-impossible to take college-level courses, which disadvantages students who have exhausted the scarce mathematical opportunities the district provides.

// personal story: was placed in LOWEST math lane, had to fight to get into NORMAL. tried to get into geo h. they didn't let me (shit talked behind my back) and then I got an A- in geo next year.

I'll begin with three personal stories, across three different subjects. In all of them, I'll sound quite pretentious — and while the wording is subject to my whims, the facts are indisputable.

The first focuses on math. PAUSD has a long history of having opaque and incomprehensible math policies. When I first arrived in the district in 8th grade, I was placed in "Math 8." It took me a week to realize that there were in fact three different lanes, and I was (by default) in the lowest of them. PAUSD had not informed myself or my parents of this, and I only found out from fellow students. So, I asked my math teacher if I could move up to Algebra 1 (the normal math lane). The answer was, "I don't think so." I talked to my counselor, this time armed with my BMO {For the Americans: BMO is the British equivalent of the AIME, but maybe a little bit less impressive.} qualification and stories about how my British math teacher had taught me trigonometry on the side {In the PAUSD, that's 10th grade math}. Until my parents got involved, however, I wasn't even allowed into the *normal* math lane at school. By default, PAUSD had placed me in the lowest possible math lane, communicated nothing about other lanes, and then worked against my efforts to be *in the standard math lane*.

Two years later, I wanted to take Multivariate Calculus at my local community college. The class had a prerequisite of only introductory differential and integral calculus. I wanted to sign up for the summer term, by which time I would have my AP Calculus BC grade (I was confident I would get a 5{I did :)}). However, the district prevented me from signing up because I hadn't completed my PAUSD graduation requirements (of Algebra 2/Trigonometry Honors). PAUSD prevents off-campus courses from receiving credit until 10th grade mathematics is completed. Even when off-campus courses are approved, they are limited to Credit/No Credit grades — but more on that later. I ended up taking a no-credit (that's not "No Credit", it's "no credit" — it doesn't appear on my transcript at all) Linear Algebra course at Stanford over the summer. Both AP Calculus BC and Linear Algebra don't appear on my transcript because they were taken before I completed Algebra 2/Trigonometry Honors (AAAAAAAA). I got a 5 on AP Calculus BC and an A in Linear Algebra. Notice the issue? PAUSD actively works against students taking more advanced courses, whether on campus or not. Their excuse, that I hadn't completed my graduation requirements, doesn't even seem to apply uniformly — three of my friends were allowed to skip Geometry Honors (a graduation requirement), while I was not. Needless to say, the district has been sued over its math policies (link), though no tangible changes have resulted.

I can imagine there are some arguments to be made for keeping students in math — after all, I’ve written an article addressing all of them (xxxxx). I’ve also explained how [the district’s opacity and bewilderingly unjustified policies inhibit students](/blog/pausd-mvc). Math is a touchy subject for the PAUSD board, it seems.

Let's move on to computer science, an elective {Electives are classes that aren't required, and a student can choose to take them.}. At my school, before taking the AP Computer Science A class (n.b. APCSA is an *introductory* Java class), students have to take either Function-Object Oriented Programming (FOOP, an introductory Python course), FOOP Honors (a more difficult version of FOOP), or AP Computer Science Principles (a class that uses block coding, skims certain things like how data is stored, and little else). All four of these classes (FOOP, FOOP H, APCSP, and APCSA) are introductory — they are each designed to *teach* their respective material. Now, I code a lot — I've been programming for six years, and I know (well enough to make projects in){In my opinion, truly the best measure of familiarlity. It is perhaps second to "able to teach someone."} six programming languages {[Check out my Github!](https://github.com/borisnezlobin)}, including Java and Python. I wanted easy weighted GPA and an AP score (AAAAAAA), so I asked the director of CS (this isn't their actual title), whom I'll call Mr. Gates {Yes, after Bill Gates}, if I could be cleared of the prerequisites for APCSA. Considering that I already knew the entirety of the content for the class, it didn't seem unreasonable. We set up a lunch meeting, where he asked me to list my experience.

Being the selfish brat I am, I mentioned a Princeton algorithms and data structures course {A great, free course that I'd recommend to anyone:}, that I do LeetCode, and that I was a member of the software team of a world-level robotics team (that uses Java). He asked me to explain how a linked list works, and said he would think about it. It's interesting to note that the most advanced data structure covered in APCSA is the ArrayList (a resizing array, if you're familiar with other languages). Knowledge of linked lists is not required to take or pass the class (or AP test). I got a perfect score in both semesters and a 5 on the AP test. To summarize, taking an intro-to-Java class at Palo Alto High School requires you to spend a year in classes that have no relevance to APCSA, or to demonstrate a knowledge of computer science far beyond the level covered in the class.

I've already mentioned briefly the struggle I've faced in taking courses off campus. In the 23-24 school year, PAUSD offered concurrent enrollment Multivariable Calculus (MVC). As an eighth period, it was about an hour after school to allow students from the other high school, Henry M. Gunn, to commute to Palo Alto High School. Demand for this class was about 50 students (in a classroom made for 30). This meant that students taking the class brought camping chairs to school or sat on the floor. It’s funny to me that one of the best-funded districts in America (AAAAAA) couldn’t provide enough chairs and desks for an advanced math class’s students. The next year, instead of offering more sections or making the class more accessible, PAUSD cancelled it entirely. The reasoning for this decision was never disclosed — I've sent numerous emails to adminstrators, but haven't heard back. Nevertheless, there was one more option for people like me looking to take the class — we could take Foothill’s asynchronous MVC online. However, by the time registration opened for high school students, there was one (1) seat left, and only 7 waitlist spots. All filled up in the first five minutes of registration, leaving more than 10 PAHS (and doubtless, numerous Gunn students as well) without even a spot on the waitlist. Well, there was one more option: take the in-person MVC Honors class (Honors was the only section not full) at De Anza College (a 20-minute drive away) in the middle of the day every Tuesday and Thursday (which would mean skipping every single one of my Physics lectures that semester). There were a few other options, but all I do is whinge and complain (AAAAAAAA), so if you're interested in how *bad* the PAUSD is at listening to students (which it claims to do) and supporting its students (which it also claims to do), [check out my article].

// trying to get off-campus courses: lol yeah right. you have to complete graduation requirements "on campus", but I have friends who skipped every single prerequisite (background)

// going up a lane in math requires you to fight for a skip test, and then it can even get revoked, lol

// multivariable calculus no longer offered as a pausd class. ok so just get it off-campus... after school... and don't get credit for it!!1! ...if you can sign up for it, lol

// APCSA: been programming for 8 years? in order to get into AP computer science, an introductory course, you need to prove that you know advanced data structures (that arent even covered by the class??). I explained how a Bloom Filter works, and the head if CS asked me to show that I knew how stack memory allocation worked... the course spends the first semester entirely on arrays and basic types. there is no mention of memory.

// physics: want to take AP Physics because you know calculus and a bit of physics already? you have to prove that you've self-studied APC ALREADY before they will let you take the class... which is supposed to teach you AP Physics.

There is hope. See, all of these issues are only for people that follow the rules. Nobody ever got ahead by following the rules, so one of my friends decided to do a little bit of trolling. During course selection, he enrolled for an Honors course three years ahead of his lane (really just for jokes). He spent two weeks in that class before dropping — not a single administrator or teacher noticed. Not only that, but several of my friends ended up 3 years ahead in math without having taken Geometry Honors (a “graduation requirement that needs to be taken on campus,” according to several administrators). How? The vibes were different.

The truth is that PAUSD’s policies apply non-uniformly, fail to accurately asses competency, and are inimical to student’s pursuits.

Throughout my three years at the Palo Alto Unified School District, I've had terrible experiences with prerequisites. It took me 6 emails to three different administrators (who are all still against me taking the class), 7 years of programming experience, 109 solved LeetCode problems, and 2 years participating in a world-championship-level robotics team (that uses Java, and one of those years was as the software lead) to be cleared for AP Computer Science A — an *introductory* Java course. It took me qualification to the British Mathematical Olympiad (Britain's equivalent of the AIME, I think) in Year 7 (6th grade for the Americans) and several meetings with my counselor to be accepted into the *regular* lane in mathematics upon arrival to the US in 8th grade. God forbid I try to lane up even once in math -- when I tried that, the only teacher of that class called me a "cheater" behind my back and refused to respond to any communication.
