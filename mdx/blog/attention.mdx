> “You who handle poverty badly will handle riches equally badly.” And that is true. In poverty she is envious. In riches she may be a snob. Money does not change the sickness, only the symptoms.

People who are distracted before will be distracted in a different way when you give them paper handouts: forcing people to stay “on topic” does not change the sickness, only the symptoms. (steinbeck)

people will know what is being taught
people will still be distracted

playing minecraft in class is bad. teachers shouldn’t let students play minecraft in class. agreeable, but is it true? so you stop letting people play minecraft in class. when I couldn’t code in physics, I played Pokémon Red on on my friend’s graphing calculator. I did my French homework in Physics, Physics Homework in CS, and Stats homework in French. Was I focusing on the classes? No. How is doing work on paper different from working on a computer? “Focus” changes the medium, not the outcome. However, in doing so, it brings to the center of the stage the teacher’s distrust in the students.

> (quote about trust, idk)

When teachers enforce a no-distraction policy to conduce their teaching, they directly show their students that *they do not trust them*. If my Physics Honors teacher says that computers should only be used on his request, it conveys in simple terms that he does not trust me to pay attention. If he then spends 15 minutes of class time pontificating about the beauty of data and human connection, I call him a hypocrite. To imply that he does not trust me to focus on his class (which must be important, if I am not allowed to be distracted), and then to lecture about his personal opinions (that bear no relevance to the course) is to tell a lion not to eat you, then proceed to read it *The Master and Margarita* instead of running away.

On a similar note, many people are already acquainted with material covered in class. Throughout my three years at the Palo Alto Unified School District, I've had terrible experiences with prerequisites. It took me 6 emails to three different administrators (who are all still against me taking the class), 7 years of programming experience, 109 solved LeetCode problems, and 3 years on a world-championship-level robotics team (that uses Java, and one of those years was as the software lead) to be cleared for AP Computer Science A — an *introductory* Java course. This complaining leads me to a very simple statement: there are always going to be students in class who are not learning a majority of the time. %% In my other article, %% I explain how better handling of prerequisites would lessen the problem — whether or not it's fixed, however, the fact remains that there are going to be people in a class who are familiar with what the class is teaching. Forcing them to "focus on the class" *has no benefit to anyone* — even if we consider "maybe this class teaches things a different way..." arguments, benefits are *completely outweighed* by the fact that these students have fundamentally lost 90 minutes of their time, and *maybe* learned a new method or some singular definition. In AP Microeconomics, a course I self-studied because only seniors are allowed to take it at my school (for whatever… imaginative reason), I learned, among other things, marginal analysis. Do the marginal analysis of a student's time in a class where they are familiar with the material when they are free to do their own work compared to when they are forced to "pay attention." You'll find something along the lines of $n:0$, where $n$ is a positive real number.

Perhaps you are considering the flip side of the equation — people that are unmotivated to learn. Instagram Reels are more interesting than French 2, no? And who even wants to learn French, right? From the teacher's perspective, it may seem that forcing all devices away will get this class interested and focused on learning. Nope. Removing alternatives does not mean support. In single-party elections, do 100% of the votes go to a single candidate? Yes. Does that make it the most popular party? French doesn't get more interesting when the Reels are taken away. I speak from experience  — when my French teacher took away my computer, I printed out past AP free response questions and did them in class. I got an A in French. Forcing a class to focus is *a whole lot of energy* for the teacher, and *accomplishes very little*. Still, for the sake of argument, let's think more deeply about this. Does forcing unmotivated students to focus increase what they learn? I'm not a scientist, but if I had to guess, my answer would be yes. Cool! Let's force all students to focus in class and take away their devices and other work! But let's stop for a moment and think for just a moment like the intellectual beings some of us are. As mentioned earlier, by shoving knowledge down the throats of the unwilling, we make the pretentious snobs like me who consider themselves bored high-achievers lose time, energy, and motivation. But whatever. We don't care about them, because knowledge is for everyone. Except... when we make people *bored*, we lose money and our ability to provide education to everyone, as I'll explain later in this article. There's one more very important point to make: education is offered to everyone. Whether everyone *learns* or *endures* education is up to them — not the teacher. Those who want to learn will learn. Those who don't can't be forced.

First, to get it out of the way — this article focuses on a high school setting, where attendance is required by law and students are beginning to figure out what exactly being alive means for them. %% Many are high achievers — they balance advanced coursework, their own companies, and various extracurriculars. %% Of course, it's dangerous to make this generalization. I won't pretend that most people in high school are the 1% —  obviously, 99% aren't. Nevertheless, 

I go to Palo Alto High School. In my English class last year, I had a nonprofit founder, the captain of an FRC robotics team, that team's business lead, and a member of a national-level SciBowl team. In a random, required class at my public high school, I was among some incredibly talented people that could be changing the world (or scrolling YouTube Shorts) instead of journaling about their feewings (sic.) and what they think *Lord of the Flies* means for us as a society. The argument here is simple: much of the time, people have better things to do. If they're not learning from a class, then there is fundamentally *no justification* for forcing them to pay attention — if you'll pardon my phrasing, net benefits to society decrease when our time and energy goes to enduring instead of learning.

// something something some people have prior experience (prerequisites!! that's another article) and don't need to listen anyways


If it seems like I have something against how my district handles prerequisites, you’re right! I’ve written an article detailing the experiences of myself and others, which [you can read here]().

// something something "but what about the idiots? taking away their phones is the only way to teach them." maybe, but there's no point forcing the entire class to pay attention


// TODO: fix

One more thing. When teachers enforce a no-distraction policy to conduce their teaching, they directly show their students that *they do not trust them*. If my Physics Honors teacher says that computers should only be used on his request, it conveys in simple terms that he does not trust me to pay attention. If he then spends 15 minutes of class time pontificating about the beauty of data and human connection, I call him a hypocrite. To imply that he does not trust me to focus on his class (which must be important, if I am not allowed to be distracted), and then to lecture about his personal opinions (that bear no relevance to the course) is to tell a lion not to eat you, then proceed to read it *The Master and Margarita* instead of running away.

So maybe you buy that teachers shouldn't force attention on their pupils because it makes classes unenjoyable, harms high-achieving students, and destroys student-teacher relationships. So what? High school is designed to be a torturous hellhole of stress and social interaction anyways, right? Unfortunately, even though it is designed that way, when classes are detrimental to the students, the school itself loses. How? Let me explain.

// explain how the school loses when kids are disappointed with classes.

The truth is that for many students, sitting through a 30-minute recap of the *Macbeth* reading homework in English class simply isn't a reason for them to pay attention to, or even show up to, English.

>The original aim of grading, which can be traced back several centuries to English universities like Oxford and Cambridge, was to motivate students. As educators found, students tended to work harder if there was a brass ring for them to reach. This fact became more important in the latter half of the 19th century, as an increasing number of states made schooling compulsory. With a new influx of reluctant pupils, many K-12 teachers were faced with a challenge even greater than keeping the average students focused: maintaining the attention of students who didn’t want to be there at all. Grades, then, also became a mechanism for coercion — rewards, but also punishments, with bad grades meant to serve as a socializing source of shame.
