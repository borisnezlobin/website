            This article outlines the story of Multivariable Calculus (MVC) in
            the Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD) from 2022 to 2024, and
            how, at nearly every turn, people in charge of providing the best
            outcomes for students have misrepresented data and used false
            justifications to disadvantage PAUSD high school students.

            In the 2023-24 school year, MVC was offered as an after-school
            concurrent enrollment (credit earned is for college; if you pass,
            you will get math credit for high school but it won’t count in your
            GPA) class — which sounds great, but it meant Palo Alto High School
            (PAHS, or, colloquially, Paly) students had to wait an hour after
            school (meaning they couldn’t participate in any after-school clubs
            or sports), and Henry M. Gunn High School (shortened to Gunn)
            students had to commute to PAHS (meaning that they couldn’t do
            after-school activities either). Not only that, but there were about
            50 students taking MVC that year… in a classroom designed for 30,
            with one teacher. Of my three friends who took the class, one
            brought a camping chair to school, and the other two were forced to
            sit on the floor. In a school where, in a one-mile radius the
            average income is nearly 10 times the national average, students
            looking to take advanced mathematics didn't have a chair to sit in.

              This issue goes beyond multivariable calculus, beyond skip tests,
              beyond math in general. At the root of this issue is the
              District’s unwillingness to listen to its students, and its
              presumption that, in the face of reasonable evidence, it knows
              what is better for the students than the students themselves. As
              we have repeatedly demonstrated before, we have tried to speak out
              many times. Dr. Austin has claimed that “engaging with students—it
              is a trap”, and other voices on the Board have made similar
              claims. They have repeatedly ignored our statements about being
              uninfluenced by parents and have stereotyped us as
              college-chasers, when in reality we are fueled by the simple
              desire to learn more about the wonderful field of mathematics.<br />

              In addition, the district’s tactics are dishonest and duplicitous.
              They have misrepresented data to further their claims, like Don
              Austin releasing a statement that, according to a survey, “more
              than 65 percent (161 students) of those who challenged a math
              course by examination were successful,” despite the fact that at
              least 139 of the 161 students could not have challenged their
              course based on their math class. In addition, in the same survey,
              42% of respondents indicated that they were either “somewhat
              likely” or “extremely likely” to take a class beyond AP Calculus
              BC in high school if they could, and yet they ignored the data to
              paint Multivariable Calculus as a low-demand course.<br />

            Going into the 2024-25 school year, there are nearly 30 students
            without a math class who were planning to take MVC. The district has
            repeatedly claimed that not offering MVC in no way negatively
            affects students: there are plenty of community colleges that offer
            MVC, and PAUSD has no need to offer a class anyways. This is true.
            There are, in a 20-minute drive, about 8 community colleges.
            However, high school students are the lowest priority, and there are
            barely any online class section seats open. The day before
            Foothill's (the "suggested" community college, and the closest)
            registration opened to high schoolers, there was one (1) seat
            available in the online section.<br />

              wasn't possible.

            To me, it's incredibly illuminating that students in one of the
            best-funded school districts in the world need to consider dropping
            one of their school classes to take advanced math — even worse, is
            that they need to email professors asking for recorded lectures.
            And, it's hypocritical to say that MVC can't be offered under CCAP
            (a dual-enrollment agreement between a school and a college), when 6
            districts in close proximity <em>offer MVC under CCAP</em>. More can

              This issue is important to all students, not just “nerds” or “math
              kids”. At the core of this issue is student voice, the idea that
              students should have a say in how the district runs. We are the
              most directly affected by the policies of the district... For any
              course offered, there will be students in it who are failing. The
              fear of having to implement strong support structures for those
              students should not be an excuse for not offering the course. That
              helps no one. We believe that if there is sufficient student
              support for a course, the district should try to accommodate the
              students who wish to sign up for it, even if it means having
              difficult conversations.<br />
