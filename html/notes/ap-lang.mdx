## Rhetoric

<InfoBox type="definition">
**Rhetoric.**<br />
Observing in any given situation the available means of persuasion.
</InfoBox>

**Rhetorical Situation.**<br />
The occasion of the text: where, when, and for whom it was published.
1. Parts of a situation:
	1. Subject. The topic of the text, the issue at hand. Should account for the entirety of the text.
	2. Author. The person or group who creates the text. Are they credentialed to talk on this subject? Every author brings their own identity and experiences to their text.
	3. Genre. The form of the text. Authors select appropriate genres given the specific demands of the occasion. For example, a TikTok wouldn't be better than a eulogy at a funeral.
	4. Context. The broader factors of where and when it was created — the historical, cultural, and social conditions of its time.
	5. Exigence (need). The urgency or motivation that gives rise to the text, that compels the author to create the text *now*. An event, a need, requirement, etc. Consider my PAUSD MVC article — it had a need after the PAUSD cancelled MVC.
	6. Audience. The reader/listener/viewer of the text.Effective authors imagine a most specific, target audience. Factors about the audience contribute to how the author conveys their message.
	7. Purpose. The goal the author wants to achieve with the audience. The author hopes to make the audience do/feel/think/believe something. Layered purpose: for complex texts, the purpose is often a layered sequence of sub-purposes — the author wants the audience to do/feel/think one thing, then another, and so on.

There are three types of rhetorical appeal:
- Ethos: how you convince an audience that you are credible
- Logos: the use of logic and reason. Analogies, examples, and research.
- Pathos: irrational (appeal to emotion).

## Rhetorical Appeals and Taking Rhetorical Risks

How does a writer appeal to an audience and challenge what they think? How does the writer effectively communicate their ideas to their audience? Aristotle identified three main types of appeal: ethos, logos, and pathos.

<InfoBox type="definition">
**Ethos** (Greek for "character")<br />
A speaker's **ethos** gives the audience a reason to listen to the writer. It could be experience, expertise, sincerity, or a combination of these things.
</InfoBox>

Ethos often emphasises the shared values between the audience and the writer. How does one build ethos? Typically, writers and speakers establish shared values or background expertise to establish credibility to the audience.

<InfoBox type="info">
>Imagine you must present your view on the same subject to two different audiences. For instance, you might be presenting your ideas on how to stop bullying to (1) the school board or a group of parents, and (2) a group of middle schoolers.

When talking to the school board, you would try to establish that you're an expert on the topic, and that you understand the school board's capabilities and incentives (perhaps by introducing yourself as a PhD in social sciences, and saying that reducing bullying will get the board reelected?). When talking to a group of parents, you would emphasise that you have the same concerns as them — every child deserves to be happy in school, but bullies should be helped instead of punished (or something, I just came up with that).
</InfoBox>

Appearing credible to the audience is only part of the key to conveying ideas. Apart from appearing credible, an author must also be, like, not stupid:

<InfoBox type="definition">
**Logos** (Greek for "embodied thought")<br />
Logos is the use of logic and reasoning in crafting a piece of persuasive writing or rhetoric.
</InfoBox>

It's the sort of thing you do when you're in an argument with your parents — you find credible sources, expert testimonies, and so on to argue your case (then, your parents say "nah, I'm right").

One trick in using logos lies beyond simple evidence supporting your case: using facts and evidence to *concede and refute*. You concede the existence of a counterargument and agree that it may be true or reasonable, but you deny the validity of all or part of the argument (join speech and debate!). This demonstrates that you understand a viewpoint other than your own, you've thought through other evidence, and still stand by your view.

In the [New York Times opinion article titled "Mother Nature is Brought to You By..."](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/opinion/sunday/mother-nature-is-brought-to-you-by.html), the author, Tim Wu, uses logos to strengthen his argument. Throughout the article (especially in the beginning), Wu uses data throughout to emphasise the spread of advertising, citing sources like *The Washington Post* and *The Associated Press*. He also gives examples ranging from school districts to marketing strategies in churches.

Of course, this wouldn't be a complete toolkit if we overlooked the success of seemingly fanatical authors like Jim Jones and Joseph Goebbels. What did they use? The third (and, in my opinion, often most powerful) and final rhetorical appeal: pathos.

<InfoBox type="definition">
**Pathos** (Greek for "passion")<br />
An appeal to emotions, values, desires, and hopes — or to fears and prejudices.
</InfoBox>

Arguments that rely solely on pathos are by definition weak, they are generally more propagandistic and polemical than persuasive — an effective author understands the power of evoking an audience's emotions.

Consider Dwight D. Eisenhower's "Order of the Day" address: you won't find any numbers in the short message, but you will find inspiring language in every sentence. Here's a list of phrases he uses that appeal to your emotions:
- "You are about to embark on the Great Crusade"
- "The eyes of the world are upon you." (schizo much...?)
- "...and security for ourselves in a free world"
- "Our Home Fronts have given us an overwhelming superirity in weapons and munitions of war and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men."
- "The tide has turned!"
- "The free men of the world are marching together to Victory!"
- "We will accept nothing less than full victory!"

Now, notice that my list is incomplete and has nearly as many entries as there are sentences in the entire message! Ethos can make people listen, logos can make people understand, but pathos can make people *act*. Nevertheless, all three are necessary in any rhetorical situation.

Let's say you're trying to convince your (skeptical) parents that a gap year would be beneficial. What combination of the rhetorical appeals would you use? Most likely, you would need a lot of ethos to convince your parents that you are more knowledgeable than them, and you'd need a lot of logos to convince them that a gap year is actually beneficial.

**Humorous and Satirical Rhetoric**<br />
Humour and satire can be effective appeals to pathos — depending on your audience. Making the audience feel better (with a joke, for example) can make them more receptive to an idea. It can also exaggerate a concept to highlight its faults or vulnerabilities. However, misusing either of these can alienate your audience, which is why we refer to them as "rhetorical risks." 

A good example of this is Animal Farm — a satirical commentary on Stalin's USSR. The book was well-received in the West, but banned in the USSR.

# Rhetorical Strategies

The style of a written work can tell us nearly as much about the author's intention as facial expressions and body language can tell us about a speaker's intention.

In Queen Elizabeth I's [speech to the troops at Tilbury](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/queen-elizabeth-speech-troops-tilbury), she's just "a feeble woman" walking among "armed multitudes" who are underpaid, hungry, and tired. How does she convince them to fight a greater enemy? She addresses their misgivings with statements like "I have the heart and stomach of a king" and "being resolved... to live and die amongst you." This makes the soldiers more trusting of her. Coming across as a mentally strong monarch, if not physically, allows Queen Elizabeth to show her trust in the soldiers, which in turn allows her to inspire them to fight and die for the country she represents. However, Queen Elizabeth uses two other powerful tools to deliver her message: tone and mood.

<InfoBox type="definition">
**Tone**<br />
Tone is the speaker's attitude toward the subject (and can be revealed through their choice of language).
</InfoBox>

<InfoBox type="definition">
**Mood**<br />
Mood is just the feeling created by the work.
</InfoBox>

In her speech, Queen Elizabeth humbles herself, then inspires and defies. So, her tone is humble, yet inspiring and defiant.

(BEGIN activity)
The tone of *Restoring Black History* can be described by the two words ''smug" and "proud" because of how it ties back to how historical ideas and how wrong/absurd they are ("the absurd charge that...") in light of this museum. The writer comes across as proud by how he describes the accomplishments of Black people ("who wanted to make history by writing it") and the museum ("brilliantly designed").
(END activity)

We can often learn more about a text by "asking it questions." For example, "what is the purpose of dropping the royal 'we' in the speech to the troops at Tilbury?" These questions can lead us to noticing things like parallelism (constructions in prose that correspond in meter, meaning, grammatical structure, sound, etc.), juxtaposition (two things near each other with contrasting effect), or antithesis (expressing a contrast of ideas with parallelism of words that are the opposites of each other). Some good questions to ask are:
- What words draw your attention? Is there something similar between all of them (part of speech, specific-ness, etc)?
- Are there words with strong connotations?
- What are the sentences like? Are they periodic (moving toward something important at the end) or cumulative (starting with an important idea and then adding details)?
- How does the writer connect words, phrases, and clauses?

(BEGIN activity)
Who is Nunberg writing to?
How does the audience react to him writing that he is "a better person for it"?
What does the author attempt to accomplish by putting commas around "above all" at the start of the excerpt and not at the end?
How do consistently periodic sentences help the writer?
Does Nunberg alienate part of his audience by using words like "coterie" and "diffident"?
(END activity)

Of course, there's what most people have already done at least once in their life: annotating. Annotating a text requires being able to mark it up, but is rather powerful and can reveal many things about the text (or about what you don't know!).

Graphic organizers are cringe. They take up too much time, space, and thinking for a task that can really be simplified to sticky note thoughts. However, they are helpful for larger projects that require a composed set of observations on a text.

(BEGIN activity)
I found that asking questions was a new approach with a lot of potential, as it made me think of questions instead of answers. For me, thinking of questions is easier than trying to find things out about the text directly. I also tend to like taking notes (not directly annotating, but more like writing down important things) on a text because it makes me take note of what I think is important.
(END activity)

(BEGIN activity)
Literary analysis is similar to rhetorical analysis because both analyze the choices a writer makes to impact the reader in some intentional way. The two are different, however, in what choices they analyze: rhetorical analysis analyzes the *meaning* of the writer, while literary analysis analyzes the way the message is delivered.

How does asking and answering rhetorical questions support Churchill's purpose? How do his extremisms ("there is no survival") make him appear to the audience? How does his repeated use of lists of four items make his purpose clearer (as opposed to using three-item lists)?

# Writing a Rhetorical Analysis Essay

Before writing an essay, analyze the rhetorical situation — use any of the strategies mentioned in the previous section to decide what you think is important.

(begin chisholm activity)<br/>In order to convince Congress that the US should spend more money on fixing America's cities and less on defense, Chisholm puts every number into context: 80bn is $2/3$ of every tax dollar, 2 more years of hunger/death of best young men, etc. She also talks about the differences between what people say and what people do (what Nixon said vs. not leaving Vietnam, Robert Finch "we should spend more on education" but not spending more on education, etc).<br/>(end chisholm activity)

Before you start writing, just put the main idea in one sentence. Then, your thesis should be something that summarizes the rhetorical strategies and addresses the specifics of the argument. For your body paragraphs, make sure to use specific evidence from the text. Beyond that, you need to have analysis of every quote. That is, how it ties in to the argument you are constructing about the author's writing.

(begin rhetorical analysis of rhetorical analysis essay activity)<br/>The thesis statement essentially enumerates the arguments that each paragraph makes. So, the topic sentences of each paragraph put together very closely resemble the thesis sentence itself. I think this is effective because it constructs a visual (essentially a "shape") in the reader's mind that allows them to better understand the argument. It also makes it easy to follow a clear line of argumentation, which makes it easier to convince the reader of a point.

I especially like the third paragraph that talks about American values. I think the writer effectively constructs an analysis of the way American "values" are used by Chisholm. She first talks about the administration's perceived values: "...administration's policy on financing war machines,
asking “what kind of values can be involved in spending $9 billion” on..." Then, she highlights Chisholm's notice of America's hypocrisy, which makes us understand how the administration is failing not only to deliver for the people it is supposedly fighting for in Vietnam, but also for the people within its own borders. By showing Chisholm's argument about America's global hyprocisy and unsolved problems at home, the writer effectively shows the values that the American government should keep to by showing what the American government is not keeping to, and how it impacts American citizens and global relations.

Honestly, I think most of rhetorical analysis is often made up and puts words in the mouths of writers that had no deeper intention. This essay seems to be a general summary of Chisholm's speech, and it reaches a reasonable conclusion about Chisholm's goals (to highlight how bad spending on defense is). I'd say that it's on the better side of rhetorical analysis essays.

I think that the speech is also largely a voting stunt — Shirley Chisholm was the first female African American representative in Congress, and this was one of her first speeches. She was a "first", and needed to prove herself in Congress — so she did this by putting forth a contrarian viewpoint (the first half of her speech is mostly just criticising the government's actions and the newly elected president) before showing her voter base that she has *their* interests at heart (refusing to vote for DoD bills), which presents herself again as a "first" (i.e. in contrast to the "rest of Congress" that allows mindless spending on the DoD). Overall, I think her speech is an appeal to her voters and a way to establish herself as a "first" in not just race and gender.
