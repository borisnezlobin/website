>A platform for Palo Alto High School that collects data from the school calendar, publications, and athletics websites. With 8 different data sources, a targeted messaging system, and a custom error reporting system, the platform is designed to be a one-stop shop for all things Paly.
## Summary

The OneShip project is a platform for Palo Alto High School that collects data from the school calendar, publications, and athletics websites. It can be accessed at [palyoneship.web.app](https://palyoneship.web.app) (no, I don’t have money for a domain), or via the mobile app (which is currently only available on Android as an APK — no, I can’t afford Apple developer licenses).

## Key Features
- **Custom Error Reporting**: OneShip has a custom uptime reporting system that will automatically report bugs (including a list of all elements that were interacted with) and notify all managers (at the moment, just me). I basically built Sentry for a hobby project, lol.
- **Targeted Messaging System**: OneShip allows administrators to send messages to specific user groups. For example, the administrators can send a message to all students, all 9th and 12th grade students, or all teachers. OneShip also uses a heuristic to determine the relevancy of each message (based on its importance, specificity, sender, and recency) and order a user’s feed.
- **Platform Extent**: OneShip is available on web, Android, and iPhone. The mobile apps send notifications before classes, with the arrival of new News articles, and for high-priority messages.
- **Cool Homepage**: the homepage of the web version (https://palyoneship.web.app) is pretty cool! It represents an electric field 

## Technologies
OneShip is built with the following technologies:

- Express.js
- React
- Firebase, Firestore, and Firebase Authentication
- Vercel Serverless
- React Native (and Expo)
- Tailwind CSS
- duct tape

## Future Plans
Due to legal student data protection restrictions, the PAUSD isn’t interested in advertising or using OneShip… and I’m a senior that doesn’t really like his high school, so I’m not developing OneShip beyond its current, highly robust state. If you’re interested in picking up development of it, [reach out to me](/contact)!
