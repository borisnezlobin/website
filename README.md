# My personal website

I made it primarily to learn NextJS and SQL, but it turned into a fun little project I work on from time to time. I've played around with design and UX on it, as well as learned how to migrate databases (turns out, the best practice isn't to clear it and start over).

Built with NextJS, SQL, Prism, Vercel, TypeScript, and my favorite font ever, Charter. Various technologies not listed due to poor memory.
