>Making a 2d Rust-based OS into a 3-dimensional experience: a high schooler's hopeless pursuit.

## Summary

I'm working on a 2d Rust-based OS that I want to turn into a 3-dimensional experience. I'm doing this because I want to learn more about operating systems, graphics, and Rust. I'm also doing this because I want to make something cool that I can show off to my friends and family.
My end goal is to have a 3d desktop environment that I can use to browse the web, watch videos, and play games. I'm not sure if I'll ever get there, but I'm having fun trying! I'm also learning a lot along the way.

Mostly I think that Apple's VisionOS is wrong in its approach to, like, everything, and I'd love to prove it (...it's actually been very difficult so far).
