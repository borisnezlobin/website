>With my copious free time, I’m working on transforming a 2D, Rust-based operating system into a 3-dimensional experience.

## Summary

I'm working on a 2D Rust-based OS that I want to turn into a 3-dimensional one that integrates with the environment. I'm doing this because I want to learn more about operating systems, graphics, and Rust.
My end goal is to have a 3D operating system that has high utility but isn't limited to a 13-inch computer screen — something that takes augments and utilizes your environment. I'm not sure if I'll ever get there, but I'm having fun trying! I'm also learning a lot along the way.

To be honest, I think that Apple's VisionOS is wrong in its approach to, like, everything, and I'd love to prove it (...it's actually been very difficult so far).
