>Collecting electrical network frequency data of the European grid and (hopefully) analyzing it to determine exact chronolocation of any European audio sample.

## Summary

I collaborate with Bellingcat's open-source team to work on parts of the ENF matching process. I've started collecting European ENF data. You can check out a full writeup of the
approach [in my article](https://bnezlobin.vercel.app/blog/enf-data), but the gist is that I found a server to misuse and started collecting ENF data from it.
These data will be published when I figure out how to, but for now I'm working on the analysis part — and learning a lot! There's not much to show for the analysis part,
but the approach is to use K-means clustering, dynamic time warping, and other techniques to match ENF data to audio samples — which allows for a precise chronolocation of the audio, as well as
an element of verification (if the ENF data doesn't match, the audio is likely fake).

### Notes

This project is a work in progress — [check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/borisnezlobin/enf)!

I'll update this page as I make progress.
