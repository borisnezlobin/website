# Introduction

Welcome to AP Statistics! I've published my notes for this class here, and modified them so that reading through them will teach you everything you need to know for the AP test. Feel free to use this as a reference, or as a textbook (although, I'm not accredited by anybody). Everything I knew going into the 2025 AP Statistics exam can be found here. If you notice any issues, or have a question, feel free to [reach out to me](/contact).

Here are a number of references that you may find helpful:

- [Skew the Script](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41zKWvU_CZI&list=PLsfM4B38vlQf_h9wEtdPBg0xBVmCkpRN7), suggested by Reddit. I've noticed that their videos don't always match the AP topics word-for-word, but it's definitely a good resource.
- [DATAtab](https://www.youtube.com/@datatab). Not an AP resource, but definitely can explain some general statistics things if you don't understand them.

# Unit 1: Exploring Single-Variable Data

### 1.1 What Can We Learn From Data?

I'm not going to beat around the bush â€” you're taking (or intersted in taking AP Statistics). You probably know that data are important. There are plenty of decisions you can make _better_ with data, and you can be much more critical of decisions being made around you if you understand how data works. I'll use data as plural and singular interchangeably, it really doesn't matter.

In our world, everything varies. That's why we need data.

Given that variations may be random or not, conclusions are never certain. Still, we want to make conclusions â€” so how do we do that? We start with collecting data. In most AP Statistics classes, the first semester focuses almost exclusively on collecting, presenting, and analyzing data. Drawing conclusions is typically left for the second semester.

So what can we learn from data? Everything.

<hr/>

### 1.2 The Language of Variation: Variables

**Variable**<br></br>
Variables are the foundation of statistics. A variable is a characteristic that changes from one individual to another. There are two types of variables: categorical and quantitative.

- **Categorical**: a categorical variable takes on values that are category names or group labels. Ex. dominant hand (left or right), highest degree earned (high school diploma, PhD, etc.), ZIP code, age group (infant, toddler, tween, teenager, adult). These are things that describe an individual and put them in a category. Most of the time, categorical variables will be words, but keep in mind that they can sometimes be numbers (like ZIP code). On the AP test, it's unlikely CollegeBoard will try to trick you with this.
- **Quantitative**: a quantitative variables takes on numerical values for a measured or counted quantity. Ex. age of a structure, height, salt concentration, number of Skittles in a pack. This explains the ZIP code example â€” you don't "measure" someone's ZIP code, and you don't "count" someone's ZIP code either. Similarly, a student ID (or Social Security number) is a categorical variable â€” you don't "measure" an ID, and you don't "count" an ID. Another good check for quantitative-ness is whether or not there's a unit after it: number of desks in a classroom ("22 desks") is a quantitative variable, while student ID ("420123") is a categorical variable. One last test: quantitative variables need to be _averaged_. You can say "the average number of Skittles is 42," but you can't say "the average high school grade level (9-12) is 10.32!" Make sure you understand this last example, and you should be good!

**Individual**<br></br>
An individual is anything that we can collect data from: people, objects, animals, places, and so on.
