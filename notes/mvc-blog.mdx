I want to take a moment to chronicle the story of Multivariable Calculus (MVC) in the Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD) from 2022 to 2024, and how, at nearly every turn, people in charge have misrepresented data and used false justifications to disadvantage students.

// use data from poll, they were wrong.

// mvc offered on campus (describe the horrors) + pausd wants to bring it back

In the 2023-24 school year, MVC was offered as an after-school concurrent enrollment (credit earned is for college; if you pass, you will get math credit for high school but it won’t count in your GPA) class — which sounds great, but it meant PAHS students had to wait an hour after school (meaning they couldn’t participate in any after-school clubs or sports), and Gunn students had to commute to PAHS (meaning that they couldn’t do after-school activities either). Not only that, but there were about 50 students taking MVC that year… in a classroom designed for 30, with one teacher. Of my three friends who took the class, one brought a camping chair to school, and the other two were forced to sit on the floor. In a school where, in a one-mile radius the average net worth is 500% (data) more than the national average, students looking to take advanced mathematics were forced to sit on the floor.

To me, this math isn’t mathing.

In math department steering notes, it is repeatedly claimed that MVC will hopefully be offered again:

A [superintendent’s update](https://www.pausd.org/about-us/news/superintendents-update/do/~board/sup/post/superintendents-update-may-19-2023) and a letter from Foothill suggest, respectively, that originally, MVC would be offered in 2023 and *expanded upon in later years*:

>Everyone has the best interest of students at the forefront... PAUSD does not offer a UC-approved MVC class and relies on Foothill College for its provision. Our efforts to expand opportunities in the area of dual enrollment are part of the proposed 2023-2024 PAUSD Promise

>Foothill College has committed to offering this sequence of courses in person, with one of our math instructors, after the conclusion of the school day... We will continue to provide dual enrollment instruction through our AB 288 agreement with PAUSD, which is a *growing* and fruitful agreement, and we will continue to *look for ways to expand our presence* with dual enrollment classes with PAUSD, where it meets both the educational mission of Foothill College and the educational mission and needs of PAUSD students and faculty.
>(emphasis mine)

Then PAUSD cancelled MVC.

Despite promising in 2023 that MVC would continue to be offered, and despite the protest of nearly 400 students, PAUSD stopped offering MVC on its campuses. This went against nearly a *century* of collaboration between PAUSD and Foothill. In October of 2023, 300 PAUSD high school students signed a petition asking for MVC. Dozens of those appeared at a board meeting where they outlined problems, causes, and solution ([read the speech](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lgEHbgKIhx3qZQFAoSllPRFJH4phZ-pwEYx6N8zMvyI/)). Unsurprisingly, I was one of the speakers. Here’s Don Austin, the PAUSD superintendent, during the students’ speeches:

I’m sure the book was interesting, but it’s incredible to me that this man can go on to claim that he “listens to the students.” I encourage everyone to read the open letter, but here are the most important parts:

>This issue goes beyond multivariable calculus, beyond skip tests, beyond math in general. At the root of this issue is the District’s unwillingness to listen to its students, and its presumption that, in the face of reasonable evidence, it knows what is better for the students than the students themselves. As we have repeatedly demonstrated before, we have tried to speak out many times. Dr. Austin has claimed that “engaging with students—it is a trap”, and other voices on the Board have made similar claims. They have repeatedly ignored our statements about being uninfluenced by parents and have stereotyped us as college-chasers, when in reality we are fueled by the simple desire to learn more about the wonderful field of mathematics.

>In addition, the district’s tactics are dishonest and duplicitous. They have misrepresented data to further their claims, like Don Austin releasing a statement that, according to a survey, “more than 65 percent (161 students) of those who challenged a math course by examination were successful,” despite the fact that at least 139 of the 161 students could not have challenged their course based on their math class. In addition, in the same survey, 42% of respondents indicated that they were either “somewhat likely” or “extremely likely” to take a class beyond AP Calculus BC in high school if they could, and yet they ignored the data to paint Multivariable Calculus as a low-demand course.

// still available at neighboring districts
// issok, we can just like… take it at foothill! there’s one spot for high schoolers
// no neighboring colleges have open seats

Students have taken every measure to have their voices heard: from board meetings, to [articles in the school newspaper](https://thecampanile.org/29268/opinion/pausd-mismanaged-multivariable-calculus-decision/); from blog posts like this one, to 

// pls vote
I can complain all I want, but the voices of students have repeatedly fallen on deaf ears. If you support students, I ask of you to do something that can truly change lives: use your vote. Do your research, and vote for candidates that will listen to students. I tend to stay apolitical, but I won’t stop myself from saying that you can change a PAUSD child’s life by voting.

I leave you with one last quote, also from the open letter:

>This issue is important to all students, not just “nerds” or “math kids”. At the core of this issue is student voice, the idea that students should have a say in how the district runs. We are the most directly affected by the policies of the district... For any course offered, there will be students in it who are failing. The fear of having to implement strong support structures for those students should not be an excuse for not offering the course. That helps no one. We believe that if there is sufficient student support for a course, the district should try to accommodate the students who wish to sign up for it, even if it means having difficult conversations.
